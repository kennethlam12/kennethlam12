# Hello and welcome to my Github!


I'm Kenneth, an incoming fourth year student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego.

I am a born engineer and I love using code to build things and impact peoples' lives. In my free time, you can find me playing games or making game mods for me and my friends!
